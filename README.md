- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Barthcbb (pseudonym)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Language Learning, Fiction, and Film.
- I'm an English philology student.
- I'm not a programmer.

I wrote these scripts because I couldn't find an Anki add-on that did all of the following:
- define a batch of words automatically
- collect their multiple meanings and examples separately (one word meaning & its example, one flashcard)
- collect their pronunciation
- format the resulting list so as to be compatible with the Anki import feature
