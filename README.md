- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Barthcbb
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Language Learning, Fiction, and Film.
- I'm an English philology student.
- I'm not a programmer.

# WHAT IS THIS?
I wrote these scripts because I couldn't find an Anki add-on that did **ALL** of the following:
- define a batch of words automatically
- collect their multiple meanings and examples **separately** (one word meaning & its example, one flashcard)
- collect their pronunciation
- format the resulting list so as to be compatible with the Anki import feature

## WHY BOTHER?
- I wanted to create flashcards that respect the minimum information principle & respected honomyms.
- I needed one separate card for each meaning and its usage example.

## WHAT NOW?
There are several improvements that I can only dream of, but don't have the skills or the time to apply. If you want to contribute, feel free.
Some interesting things would be:
- making it an actual add-on
- pulling from Kindleâ€™s vocab.db
- pulling other relevant metadata attached to the meaning (such as register â€˜formal/informalâ€™, and context â€˜medical/historical/scientificâ€™)
- unifying the script to pull from both the EN-US and EN-GB corpus
- make it into an app/web app (I would happily purchase something like that)

That's it folks.
